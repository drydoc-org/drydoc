# drydoc
Drydoc generates a static, server-less HTML container for documentation. A project may have Gitbooks,
doxygen pages, markdown files, PDFs, and other resources. This tool generates a HTML
wrapper page that exposes all of these resources in an easy-to-use interface.

The generated HTML does not require any external libraries, and thus may be viewed without an internet
connection (assuming all contained resources also do not require the internet).

## Configuration
A `drydoc.yaml` file is used to configure drydoc. Drydoc configurations can be hierarchical, allowing
large organizational documentation pages or single project pages in a modular way.
